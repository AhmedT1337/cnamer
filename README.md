# cnamer
This tool fetches the CNAME domain of every domain you give in a file and prints the satus code next to it.

usage : this tool can be used to find subdomain takeover vulnerabilities.

The tool can be edited and modyfied to work for other dns records (maybe in the future we will make it this way).

how to use it :
- run the script with python3
- put a txt file contains domains you want to pass through the script (next to cnamer.py)
- put the txt file as the first file
- done!


example :
python3 cnamer.py list.txt

The tool still in early levels so if you have any suggestions, recommendations, opinions or adjustments please contact me on my twitter.
